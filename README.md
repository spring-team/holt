You're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.

I believe in you. You can do the thing!

As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.

Itâ€™s only a thought, and a thought can be changed.

I come from the loving space of my heart, and I know that love opens all doors.

I come from the loving space of my heart, and I know that love opens all doors.

You are the delta in what you do, not the things you did in the past
